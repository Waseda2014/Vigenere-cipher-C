vigenere cipher in c

This is the implementation of vigenere cipher in c.

Instead of using a single number as the key to encrypt the message, vigenere cypher uses
a key word as the enryption key, and shifts each letter in the message according to the 
value of the key. 

A=0 B=1 C=2 and so forth, regardless of upper or lower cases
